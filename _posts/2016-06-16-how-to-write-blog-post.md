# How it works
This site uses Jekkyl generator, that is implicitly used by github pages.
See https://jekyllrb.com/docs/posts/. Once something is pushed to https://github.com/TAW-Arma/am2.taw.net/tree/gh-pages the website is regenerated by Jekkyl and shown on http://taw-arma.github.io/am2.taw.net/.

# How do I make a post ?
1. You need a github account.
2. Then you need your own version of this website in which you can make changes. Aka you need to fork this repository

5. Go to _posts folder.
6. Create new file with name: YEAR-MONTH-DAY-title.MARKUP where the MARKUP means a FORMAT you want to use. ATM you can use .html or .md
   I prefer the .md [markdown](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/) because you can Preview it directly on github.
7. Copy paste the YAML Front Matter section at the top of your post. Edit the section according to you.

    ```

    ```
8. Add post contents. Preview changes to see how it will look.
9. Commit changes.
10. Once you are done you can now request to merge the changes you made. Aka request to have the post added to the original repository you copied(forked) from. Also called pull request, as in the changes you made are pulled from your repository to the original one.
